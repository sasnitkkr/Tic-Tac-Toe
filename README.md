Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented usig `HTML` `CSS` and `Javascript`.

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

It takes input(where the player wants to move his next move), until either one of the player wins or the game end being draw.

The latest status of the game is checked by `checkWin()` and `checkDraw()` functions.
If the game is won or drawn the game ends with the respective message else it continues altering the turn of players.

And finally the game is cool to play, and it's a small thing which gives you real good experience and excitement.
